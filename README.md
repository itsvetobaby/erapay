<h2>Premise</h2>

Luke Skywalker has no convenience store. If he needs something it turns up on some cargo drone which then zips off again. How do we get that on earth. <br>

Maybe were talking the need for speeder parts. What spec are the parts? Where are the blueprints from, where will they be made? Mos Eisley? Or somewhere with more specialized machinery - how will the parts be transported back? What time frame are we on?


 What if we automate, and for everything - Crops, houses, clothing. 



If a region can produce 100% of its demand can we say it's fully autonomous? What's the implication for this - could it become sovereign? Could we bootstrap countries with turnkey means of production? <br>
How much can we automate? If the robots are outmanning(pardon the pun) fields then can humans just kick back for the next eternity? Sounds like a future worth exploring.

<h2>Theory Architecture</h2>

> Blueprint - the basic building block: a 3d model, a chemical formula or a program. Their editable, cloneable, scarce or non-scarce, and can be ordered. <br>
>> Order - How you're going to get a blueprint made into something physical. Additional requests are added here for spec. Orders are taken on by producers if they are capable.<br><br>
>> Catalog - think ikea catalog, a collection of blueprints belonging to a user or cell.<br>

> MOPE - Measure of production expertise - do you have machinery to make orders. This can be individually owned or it can belong to a cell. This will be the measure of Autonomy

<br>

> Cell - a collection of individuals in close physical proximity a.k.a a country
