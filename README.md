The IRL colony management game.

<h2>Premise</h2>

Luke Skywalker has no convenience store. If he needs something it turns up on some cargo drone which then zips off again. How do we get that on earth. <br>

Maybe were talking the need for speeder parts. What spec are the parts? Where are the blueprints from, where will they be made? Mos Eisley? Or somewhere with more specialized machinery - how will the parts be transported back? What time frame are we on?


Automate, for everything - Optimised for Autonomy.

No build tools! It just serves the `src` directory at http://localhost:8080

Eslint: `yarn eslint src/js/*.js --fix;yarn eslint src/js/components/*.js --fix`

The application was originally built in plain jQuery without a framework. While we now use [preact](https://preactjs.com/), there's still some jquery logic that should be ported.

## Privacy
Private messages are end-to-end encrypted, but message timestamps and the number of chats aren't. In a decentralized network this information is potentially available to anyone.

By looking at timestamps in chats, it is possible to guess who are chatting with each other. It is also possible, if not trivial, to find out who are communicating with each other by monitoring data subscriptions on the decentralized database.

In that regard, Iris prioritizes decentralization and availability over perfect privacy.

Profile names, photos and online status are currently public. That can be changed when advanced group permissions are developed.

The application is an unaudited proof-of-concept implementation, so don't use it for security critical purposes.
